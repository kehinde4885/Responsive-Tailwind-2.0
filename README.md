Carryover of Lessons from v1.0 to build a faster , more efficient Tailwind site in Preparation for commercial usage

Iterating on Previous Experiences, i can now conclude that these are whats neccessary to Start a Tailwind Project
images, Typography , Videos , Colors, Screen Sizes for Adaptability , Layout Planning

Tailwind makes Responsive building very easy compared to normal CSS.

This is almost a perfect Clone.
To Properly clone this website i had to break down each sections responsiveness one by one using Pen and Paper
Full Sketch can be Found in My Notion Notes. (Would also add it here as a link in google or something)


Moving Forwards, i need to be able to build webpages faster using Tailwind, so i would practise a couple more Pages.

I am of the opinion that the full Potential of Tailwind would be unleashed when building a Website with Multiple 
Pages, that way Similar Components and Utilities can be easily moved from Page to Page without Writing new Code

NOTES
Layout was Done in a Custom CSS File, that way all layout is in one place and can easily be Edited at a glance.
Components are built in HTMl.
